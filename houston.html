        <p>We are moving to Houston! I know that Lindsay loves staying in one place, but we have not had much opportunity to settle down since we've been married. I have an internship in Houston, so I have to drag her along with me. Thankfully, we will be near where we got married, and we will be close to her family. She is such a sweetheart for sticking with me for all of this.</p>
